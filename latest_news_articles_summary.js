        "summary": "Thirteen countries experienced an increase in voter turnout compared to 2019:    Hungary saw the most significant increase in turnout (+15.93 points). Radio Schuman This is Radio Schuman, your new go-to podcast to spice up your weekday mornings with relevant news, insights, and behind-the-scenes from Brussels and beyond. 2024 saw the highest voter turnout in 30 years, with 50.97% of the 357 million eligible citizens participating in the election. This is a slight increase compared to the previous elections in 2019 (50.66%), suggesting the politically charged context served as a catalyst for participation. Lithuania experienced the largest decrease, with turnout dropping to 28.35%, a loss of 25 points compared to 2019. Indeed, countries that joined the European Union after 2004 tend to vote less than those that were members before 2004. The 2024 European elections were more critical than ever, serving as a barometer of public opinion across the 27 member states. This can be partly attributed to the recent presidential election held on 12 and 26 May, which had a turnout of 59%. Since the 2004 \"Big Bang\" enlargement to the East, a gap has been observed between Western and Eastern countries. Crucial issues such as climate change, the future of the European Green Deal, post-COVID-19 economic recovery, migration, and the EU's role on the global stage were on the agenda.",

Baby dolphins invent their own names, called signature whistles, and parrots may also use names. Scientists believe that animals with complex social structures and family groups that separate and then reunite often may be more likely to use individual names. Each of these naming species also possesses the ability to learn to pronounce unique new sounds throughout their lives - a rare talent that elephants also possess. Researchers tested their results by playing recordings to individual elephants, who responded more energetically, ears flapping and trunk lifted, to recordings that contained their names. The names are one part of elephants' low rumbles that they can hear over long distances across the savanna. Humans have names, of course, and pet dogs come when their names are called. It’s extremely rare for wild animals to call each other by unique names. Analysing only the audio data, the computer model predicted which elephant was being addressed 28 per cent of the time, likely due to the inclusion of its name. Researchers found that the low rumbles of African elephants could be them calling one another by name.",

Tiger mosquitoes spread diseases such as dengue fever, chikungunya and Zika virus which, until recently, were typically only present in parts of Africa, Asia and the Americas. Climate change is creating favourable conditions for the tiger mosquito to spread, said the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). But locally-acquired infections are also rising: 130 people were affected in 2023, up from 71 the year before. It spreads to people through the bites of infected female mosquitoes called anopheles, which have also been found in Europe. Experts say its potential for spreading to other parts of Europe is \"concerning\" given its preference for biting humans, and its ability to transmit disease. It has advised people to remove stagnant water from gardens or balconies, where mosquitoes can breed, and use repellent as well as screens on windows and doors. Another mosquito, aedes aegypti, which transmits yellow fever, as well as other diseases, has set up home in Cyprus. There are concerns incidents of malaria could also spike on the continent in the future, if conditions are right.",

Only an increase in the sustainability of activities can improve alignment, while for other sectors there is more scope to improve eligibility and alignment from relatively low levels. In addition, real estate companies were up until recently only able to report on activities with a substantial contribution towards climate change mitigation (CCM) and climate change adaptation (CCA). All in all, real estate displays high eligibility and alignment levels for Turnover, CapEx and OpEx compared to most other sectors. This likely means that lending will increasingly be directed to sectors, companies and activities which have a higher alignment or where alignment is improving. In addition, the introduction of the Circular Economy Objective from this year further widened the scope of activities that real estate companies can report on. Average alignment is 18%, with only two companies reporting a rate above 50% (both again French retail companies, Klepierre and Unibail). This is somewhat favourable for real estate companies, as current alignment levels are relatively high.

Currently,“Frexit” is no longer seen as a risk, but markets are looking somewhat jittery ahead of the snap parliamentary election scheduled for 30 June/7 July. In periods of political turmoil in the EU, EUR/USD showed a tendency to build a risk premium (i.e., EUR/USD being undervalued for some time). Euro credit is fairly priced to a touch rich and trading within this range as technical strength and yield attraction keep credit at these tight levels. Our financial fair value model uses a number of interest rate and equity variables to estimate the short-term fair value of a currency pair. To gauge how far the euro can fall, we try to estimate what kind of risk premium is in EUR/USD, for example. As a macro backdrop, we have the ECB's quantitative tightening which in and of itself exerts widening pressure on bond spreads. The French presidential elections of 2017 saw the spread spike to around 80bp.",

This shared apprehension may be the glue that holds together an otherwise fragmented alliance, ensuring that Sánchez's government can continue to function despite potential challenges. The competition between Sánchez's allies and his socialists in parliament has already stalled several initiatives and prevented the premier from passing the general budget. Despite these internal challenges, one factor unites the diverse parliamentary bloc supporting Sánchez: the fear of a potential coalition between the centre-right and the far right. Spain's centre-right PP party came on top in the European elections on Sunday. And while PP enjoyed renewed popularity, Sánchez's socialist PSOE party retained a solid base of support. Yet, their resurgence did not result in the collapse of Premier Pedro Sánchez's government as the conservatives had hoped. The prospect of a PP-Vox coalition could drive Sánchez's allies to remain united. The Spanish prime minister still has three years left in his term and currently has no intention of calling early elections.

In his new documentary ‘Tehachapi’, French street artist JR reveals the behind-the-scenes of a four-year-long project with inmates of an American prison. “I think this project taught me a lot, but I think the thing that got me by surprise is the question of change: Can we change? In “one of the most impactful moments”, Kevin describes how a guard spoke to his mom as she was visiting him shortly after one of the projects. “I went after three days of getting the permit, I went in there thinking, let's do it very quickly before they remove that permit. And for the last three and a half years, we've been coming back and we're going to continue to go back,” he tells Euronews Culture. With its behind-the-scenes approach, the documentary relates how the austere prison courtyard becomes an ephemeral canvas for the inmates. He even went back to work in Tehachapi, this time in a black jumpsuit - the standard outfit for JR’s crew members. JR’s team collaborated with inmates and guards to use its signature technique of flyposting to create a giant portrait of 40 men. “The exchange session was great,” a member of the audience, who is also a photographer, tells Euronews Culture.",

With the increased prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI), there is a greater demand for precise diagnostic tools such as blood-based cystatin C assays. This region's dominance stems from a mix of modern healthcare infrastructure, high healthcare spending, and rising awareness of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI). Insights by Sample Type  The blood samples segment is dominating the market with the largest market share over the forecast period 2023 to 2033. Insights by Application  The diagnostics segment is dominating the market with the largest market share over the forecast period 2023 to 2033. The growing interest in personalised healthcare solutions highlights the need for precise biomarkers such as cystatin C to modify treatment approaches for kidney disease patients. In the end-use application stage, cystatin C assays are employed for diagnosing and monitoring kidney function in patients, with a growing emphasis on personalized medicine and point-of-care testing. The demographic transition towards an ageing population in many Asia-Pacific countries raises the prevalence of age-related kidney disorders, emphasising the importance of precise kidney function tests. The introduction of blood-based cystatin C assays is driven by an increased awareness of the necessity of early detection and regular monitoring of kidney function. Rising global healthcare expenditure, combined with expenditures in research infrastructure, promotes the use of improved diagnostic technologies and collaboration between diagnostic corporations and research institutions.",

Baby dolphins invent their own names, called signature whistles, and parrots may also use names. Scientists believe that animals with complex social structures and family groups that separate and then reunite often may be more likely to use individual names. Each of these naming species also possesses the ability to learn to pronounce unique new sounds throughout their lives - a rare talent that elephants also possess. Researchers tested their results by playing recordings to individual elephants, who responded more energetically, ears flapping and trunk lifted, to recordings that contained their names. The names are one part of elephants' low rumbles that they can hear over long distances across the savanna. Humans have names, of course, and pet dogs come when their names are called. It’s extremely rare for wild animals to call each other by unique names. Analysing only the audio data, the computer model predicted which elephant was being addressed 28 per cent of the time, likely due to the inclusion of its name. Researchers found that the low rumbles of African elephants could be them calling one another by name.",

Tiger mosquitoes spread diseases such as dengue fever, chikungunya and Zika virus which, until recently, were typically only present in parts of Africa, Asia and the Americas. Climate change is creating favourable conditions for the tiger mosquito to spread, said the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). But locally-acquired infections are also rising: 130 people were affected in 2023, up from 71 the year before. It spreads to people through the bites of infected female mosquitoes called anopheles, which have also been found in Europe. Experts say its potential for spreading to other parts of Europe is \"concerning\" given its preference for biting humans, and its ability to transmit disease. It has advised people to remove stagnant water from gardens or balconies, where mosquitoes can breed, and use repellent as well as screens on windows and doors. Another mosquito, aedes aegypti, which transmits yellow fever, as well as other diseases, has set up home in Cyprus.

In addition, real estate companies were up until recently only able to report on activities with a substantial contribution towards climate change mitigation (CCM) and climate change adaptation (CCA). All in all, real estate displays high eligibility and alignment levels for Turnover, CapEx and OpEx compared to most other sectors. This likely means that lending will increasingly be directed to sectors, companies and activities which have a higher alignment or where alignment is improving. In addition, the introduction of the Circular Economy Objective from this year further widened the scope of activities that real estate companies can report on. Average alignment is 18%, with only two companies reporting a rate above 50% (both again French retail companies, Klepierre and Unibail). This is somewhat favourable for real estate companies, as current alignment levels are relatively high.

Currently,“Frexit” is no longer seen as a risk, but markets are looking somewhat jittery ahead of the snap parliamentary election scheduled for 30 June/7 July. In periods of political turmoil in the EU, EUR/USD showed a tendency to build a risk premium (i.e., EUR/USD being undervalued for some time). Euro credit is fairly priced to a touch rich and trading within this range as technical strength and yield attraction keep credit at these tight levels. Our financial fair value model uses a number of interest rate and equity variables to estimate the short-term fair value of a currency pair. To gauge how far the euro can fall, we try to estimate what kind of risk premium is in EUR/USD, for example. As a macro backdrop, we have the ECB's quantitative tightening which in and of itself exerts widening pressure on bond spreads.

        "summary": "Campaigners working to get a funding mechanism for abortion at a European level say the election results have made the effort even more urgent than before. For Coffin, the election results show it is increasingly urgent “to forge practices, reflections, communities of resistance and struggle outside traditional political parties”. Women's rights campaigners say a surge in support for the far-right in Europe has made efforts to fund abortion at the EU level even more urgent than before. But, she said, “It will be more complicated and above all what [the election results] show is even more urgency for such an initiative to be [voted]”. The results in France also “reinforce” the importance of having inscribed abortion in the Constitution, she said.

Alice Coffin is coordinating the My Voice, My Choice campaign in France and has been travelling to strongholds of the far-right as part of the effort to collect signatures. While RN leaders voted in favour of the measure, some right-wing and far-right MPs abstained or voted against it.

Among the 20 most viral debunked posts that received no action by the platforms, 18 were hosted in X with over 1,5 million views each. In December 2023, the European Commission started an investigation under the DSA into X's handling of risk management, content moderation, dark patterns, advertising transparency and data access for researchers. \"We’ve also connected voters across the EU to authoritative sources of news and information through our recommendation system,\" the spokesperson added. The Commission said in April it fears they are vulnerable to Russian networks, and lacked the right tools to deal with deceptive advertising and political content on its services.

This shared apprehension may be the glue that holds together an otherwise fragmented alliance, ensuring that Sánchez's government can continue to function despite potential challenges. The competition between Sánchez's allies and his socialists in parliament has already stalled several initiatives and prevented the premier from passing the general budget. Despite these internal challenges, one factor unites the diverse parliamentary bloc supporting Sánchez: the fear of a potential coalition between the centre-right and the far right. Spain's centre-right PP party came on top in the European elections on Sunday. And while PP enjoyed renewed popularity, Sánchez's socialist PSOE party retained a solid base of support. Yet, their resurgence did not result in the collapse of Premier Pedro Sánchez's government as the conservatives had hoped. The prospect of a PP-Vox coalition could drive Sánchez's allies to remain united. The Spanish prime minister still has three years left in his term and currently has no intention of calling early elections.

It took her ten years to increase her far-right party's 3.7% share of the vote in the 2014 European elections sevenfold. Indeed, she has reasons to be thankful, and one thing is certain: the “just write Giorgia” slogan paid off.

Officials could be seen at the site in the morning, inspecting the charred shops or breaking metal gates to bring out animals that survived the fire. Hundreds of caged animals died on Tuesday after a fire struck Chatuchak Weekend Market, one of the most famous markets in Thailand’s capital. The cause of the fire is being investigated, said Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt, who visited the scene after the fire was put out. A popular tourist attraction, 'JJ' Market's pet section has previously drawn criticism from wildlife organisations. Officials said it took them about an hour to bring the fire under control. Officials said they are still working on estimating the cost of damage, and that affected shop owners could register for compensation. Wildlife organisations have often accused some vendors of involvement in the trafficking of rare and endangered species, such as turtles, tortoises and birds.",

With the increased prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI), there is a greater demand for precise diagnostic tools such as blood-based cystatin C assays. This region's dominance stems from a mix of modern healthcare infrastructure, high healthcare spending, and rising awareness of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI). Insights by Sample Type  The blood samples segment is dominating the market with the largest market share over the forecast period 2023 to 2033. Insights by Application  The diagnostics segment is dominating the market with the largest market share over the forecast period 2023 to 2033. The growing interest in personalised healthcare solutions highlights the need for precise biomarkers such as cystatin C to modify treatment approaches for kidney disease patients. In the end-use application stage, cystatin C assays are employed for diagnosing and monitoring kidney function in patients, with a growing emphasis on personalized medicine and point-of-care testing. The demographic transition towards an ageing population in many Asia-Pacific countries raises the prevalence of age-related kidney disorders, emphasising the importance of precise kidney function tests. The introduction of blood-based cystatin C assays is driven by an increased awareness of the necessity of early detection and regular monitoring of kidney function.

The war in Ukraine has also enabled parties such as the AfD and FPÖ to denounce governments doing their utmost to support Kiev, accusing them of“warmongering”.",

        "summary": "We can't say Mustian is“typical” of amateur playwrights during her time due to the vast number of plays lost. This was a time when the“boy actress” phenomenon was ubiquitous among the major professional theatre companies. Margaret Benbury, the next-door neighbour, claims Mustian“did prompte and teache the said Actors as they were upon the stage”. This is the case for most plays written and performed in early modern England. We also know that while Mustian had teenage daughters, a nine-year-old boy named Augustine Hodds or Hodges performed the female role. Witnesses in the trial provide a compelling case to believe there was a text composed prior to the performance. Often these plays were written by women from aristocratic families moving in elite and literary circles. As the evidence makes clear, Mustian was demonstrably capable of initiating and planning the logistics of an entire dramatic entertainment, serving both as playwright and impresario. According to locals, Mary Roberts, who had moved to the parish around ten years earlier, was one such enemy. Salisbury local Rombald Benbury, who had seen the play, also reported Roberts's reaction:\nRoberts soon sued Mustian for defamation.",

Radio Schuman This is Radio Schuman, your new go-to podcast to spice up your weekday mornings with relevant news, insights, and behind-the-scenes from Brussels and beyond. 2024 saw the highest voter turnout in 30 years, with 50.97% of the 357 million eligible citizens participating in the election. This is a slight increase compared to the previous elections in 2019 (50.66%), suggesting the politically charged context served as a catalyst for participation. Lithuania experienced the largest decrease, with turnout dropping to 28.35%, a loss of 25 points compared to 2019. Indeed, countries that joined the European Union after 2004 tend to vote less than those that were members before 2004. The 2024 European elections were more critical than ever, serving as a barometer of public opinion across the 27 member states. This can be partly attributed to the recent presidential election held on 12 and 26 May, which had a turnout of 59%. Since the 2004 \"Big Bang\" enlargement to the East, a gap has been observed between Western and Eastern countries.

Baby dolphins invent their own names, called signature whistles, and parrots may also use names. Scientists believe that animals with complex social structures and family groups that separate and then reunite often may be more likely to use individual names. Each of these naming species also possesses the ability to learn to pronounce unique new sounds throughout their lives - a rare talent that elephants also possess. Researchers tested their results by playing recordings to individual elephants, who responded more energetically, ears flapping and trunk lifted, to recordings that contained their names. The names are one part of elephants' low rumbles that they can hear over long distances across the savanna. Humans have names, of course, and pet dogs come when their names are called. It’s extremely rare for wild animals to call each other by unique names. Analysing only the audio data, the computer model predicted which elephant was being addressed 28 per cent of the time, likely due to the inclusion of its name. Researchers found that the low rumbles of African elephants could be them calling one another by name.",

Tiger mosquitoes spread diseases such as dengue fever, chikungunya and Zika virus which, until recently, were typically only present in parts of Africa, Asia and the Americas. Climate change is creating favourable conditions for the tiger mosquito to spread, said the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). But locally-acquired infections are also rising: 130 people were affected in 2023, up from 71 the year before. It spreads to people through the bites of infected female mosquitoes called anopheles, which have also been found in Europe. Experts say its potential for spreading to other parts of Europe is \"concerning\" given its preference for biting humans, and its ability to transmit disease. It has advised people to remove stagnant water from gardens or balconies, where mosquitoes can breed, and use repellent as well as screens on windows and doors. Another mosquito, aedes aegypti, which transmits yellow fever, as well as other diseases, has set up home in Cyprus. There are concerns incidents of malaria could also spike on the continent in the future, if conditions are right.",
