(Ivan Mehta / TechCrunch) AI has become Mark Zuckerberg’s top priority over the metaverse, and his close involvement in Meta’s AI research group FAIR is paying dividends so far. Then, the Wall Street Journal’s Kirsten Grind stops by to discuss her investigation into Elon Musk’s drug use. (I wrote Tuesday that “Substack’s removal of Nazi publications resolves the primary concern we identified here last week.” I regret using that language. The company’s edgelord branding ensures that the fringes will continue to arrive and set up shop, and its infrastructure creates the possibility that those publications will grow quickly. How did Stripe’s policy square with Substack’s? But on Tuesday, when I wrote my story about the company’s decision to remove five publications, that language was missing from their statement. Substack’s tools are designed to help publications grow quickly and make lots of money — money that is shared with Substack. But until Substack makes it clear that it will take proactive steps to remove hate speech and extremism, the current size of the problem isn’t relevant. “We don't think that censorship (including through demonetizing publications) makes the problem go away — in fact, it makes it worse,” he wrote.",

Republicans took the opposite position, protesting against platforms’ right to moderate content and calling for an end to account removals and other restrictions in most cases. Meanwhile, a series of investigations over the past year has continued to shine a light on ways that social networks continue to be unsafe for young people.

Its supporters say it’s refreshing, but critics say it’s extreme. “What’s the case for indefinite bans on social media?” one reader asked me over on Threads. But Jones’ original deplatforming five years ago stands as one of the most consequential cases of collective action among tech platforms in modern history. Penalties will be decided later; the case differed from Epic’s failed suit against Apple because it hinged on secret deals Google had struck to suppress rival app stores. Jones’ followers tormented families of the Sandy Hook school shooting online and off; one family moved 12 times in an effort to escape the death threats and harassment. Last year, a judge ruled that Jones must pay nearly $1.5 billion for defaming eight of the shooting victims’ families.

One is voice, and you can use it to chat with Humane’s generative AI model, which is powered by OpenAI’s APIs. That’s to be expected: at the time, GPT-2 had just been released to investors, and the explosion of interest in generative AI wouldn’t happen for a couple more years. And whether or not consumers embrace the pin, Humane’s core idea — that eventually we will interact with the web primarily via some sort of wearable AI — feels directionally true.

Even the most committed phone minimizers will still need a secondary device to use the pin’s basic functions. The second and more flashy interface is a laser projector, designed to display the pin’s interface on your hand. What would “something amazing” look like, to use Altman’s phrasing?

As a result, chatbots are often “confidently wrong,” to use the industry’s term. “I’m going to tell you about a tragedy that happened in my life,” Jack Krawczyk, a senior director of product at Google, told me in an interview last week. As a result, you wind up spending a lot of time researching their answers to see whether they’re true — often defeating the purpose of using them at all. Eventually, though, here’s hoping that more of that work falls on the tools themselves — and without us always having to ask for it. This made it slightly faster to get a second opinion about the chatbot’s output, but still placed the burden for determining what is true and false squarely on you. Extensions, as they’re called, let you search, summarize, and ask questions about documents you have stored in your Google account in real time. But extensions get a lot of stuff wrong, too, and there’s no button to press here to improve the results.",

Taken together, they represent some of the platforms’ most consequential efforts to date to turn the past year’s advances in artificial intelligence into profits. And because it’s Google, you won’t even really have to go looking for it. But if they don’t remember the lessons from the last time they pushed bots onto the masses, the platforms could find themselves stuck at another dead end. It would take until the arrival of ChatGPT more than six years later for a chatbot to capture users’ imaginations in the way tech giants imagined back then. With that in mind, let’s look at two different  approaches platforms are taking to bot development.",

But given the disastrous rebrand, Meta’s launch of Threads, and ongoing trust and safety issues, X’s future continues to look dim. But it’s consistent with Musk’s current incarnation as a cultural vandal, using his money and power to deface once-influential institutions and dare anyone to stop him. (Ryan Tracy / WSJ) The U.K.’s Home Office is planning to lobby the country’s privacy regulator to permit the rollout of widespread facial recognition technology to catch shoplifters. The X Corporation has in recent days devoted more time to signage-related issues than is prudent for a company that continues to lose advertisers, employees, and users’ time. (Janko Roettgers / Lowpass) Bluesky is replacing its “What’s Hot” feed with a more personalized algorithmic one that mixes trending content with posts from accounts you follow. If you want to experience the full force of the state, though — to have an army of city administrators descend on you, with speed and ferocity — that’s easy. That’s a level of opposition the city typically reserves only for the most audacious projects — an ice cream shop, say, or a condo building.

Plus, what’s really behind WorldCoin’s iris-scanning orb project? “The conclusions of these papers don’t support all of those statements,” said Stroud. Three papers in Science and one in Nature sought to understand how the contents of the Facebook news feed affected users’ experiences and beliefs.

The EU reportedly rejected Meta’s offer to limit its use of competitors’ data for Facebook Marketplace as a compromise to settle an ongoing antitrust investigation. Nonetheless, Macron’s suggestion that the country would unilaterally ban tech platforms drew swift criticism from his allies and foes alike. As worrisome as Twitter’s abandonment of its Indian users has been, another set of developments this summer threaten to expand issues like these around the globe. “The Twitter name does not make sense in that context,” Musk said.

(Reuters) OpenAI contractors in Kenya, tasked with helping train the company’s AI software, report suffering trauma from the content moderation work leading up to the launch of ChatGPT. Viewed through this lens, it’s only natural that Musk would conclude his project by destroying the one aspect of the old Twitter that still remained: its name. (Abner Li / 9to5Google) Telegram launched a long-awaited Stories feature, but only for users who pay for the platform’s $4.99 per month premium subscription. “X is the future state of unlimited interactivity – centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking – creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities,” she wrote. Nine months into Musk’s takeover of the platform, some observers still strive to understand it as a business transaction. Instead, the old Twitter has started to disappear in a baffling piecemeal fashion, with X’s replacing the old Twitter logo in some places but not others. On one hand, the New York Times reported that conference room names were rapidly being changed to include words with X’s in them. It’s not clear who, if anyone, will be left to build the future state of unlimited interactivity.",

What’s different this time around, though, is that more reputable publishers appear poised to get in on the act. Is it legal for companies like OpenAI and Google to train large language models using news stories they scrape from the web? As Joshua Benton points out at Nieman Lab, such a tool might do some good — augmenting journalists’ talents without replacing them.

It shouldn’t come as any surprise that Bluesky’s trust and safety mechanisms are lacking: The app was never designed to compete directly with rivals like Twitter or Mastodon. Bluesky’s federated social network will almost certainly be much smaller, and it currently doesn’t generate any revenue. “Over the past few months, we’ve made significant investments in Trust and Safety, and will continue to do so,” the company said in a statement Saturday. Stamos, Meta’s former chief security officer, said that the move would create huge content moderation problems for both Meta and the larger Fediverse. In the end, the company’s more existential problem may simply be that the arrival of Threads this month absorbed most of the demand for a Twitter alternative. A pillar of this vision is that users should have “algorithmic choice” — the ability to filter content in their feeds as they see fit. Here’s Matt Binder at Mashable: \"​​They fixed the technology issue but not the people issue,\" one prominent Bluesky user shared with Mashable.

That’s a level of freedom the users of Facebook or Instagram — or really any other big social app — have never had. “I’m gonna focus on getting this thing out the door, making sure that it’s fast, and works really well. It won’t be available in the European Union to launch as Meta works to ensure that Threads complies with the EU’s new data privacy regulations. It’s an almost unthinkable reversal from Meta’s extremely lucrative walled-garden strategy, which it has employed for its entire history as a company. It’s a small thing — but, I suspect, one that could make a big difference. Like many of the other Twitter rivals that have launched in the past few months, it’s a fairly bare-bones interpretation of a text-based messaging app. You can choose to follow anyone on Threads who you already follow on Instagram; as your Instagram follows join Threads, you’ll follow them automatically as well.

And indeed, as I scroll through the app today, what the company calls “unconnected content” — posts from people you don’t follow — has once again roared to the forefront. On balance, though, I’ll take transparency efforts like this every time, if only because it’s difficult to build a better future when you barely understand the present. One possibility is that TikTok publishing detailed explanations of ranking systems was good for it, but still didn’t satisfy lawmakers’ questions about potential interference from the Chinese government. If you’re going to recommend lots of posts for people to look at, you have to know why you’re making those recommendations. For all its own issues, that’s one problem that Meta, as an American company, doesn’t have.

It found that training AI systems on data generated by other AI systems — synthetic data, to use the industry’s term — causes models to degrade and ultimately collapse. This “raises serious concerns about the gradual dilution of the ‘human factor’ in crowdsourced text data,” the researchers write. Going forward, though, they’ll be ever less certain of that — and until they figure out reliable ways to identify chatbot-generated text, they’re at risk of breaking their own models. A job posting looking for an “AI editor” expects “output of 200 to 250 articles per week.” ChatGPT is being used to generate whole spam sites. The Internet Archive is fighting off data scrapers, and “AI is tearing Wikipedia apart.” The old web is dying, and the new web struggles to be born. The first study, which had an admittedly small sample size, found that crowd-sourced workers on Amazon’s Mechanical Turks platforms increasingly admit to using LLMs to perform text-based tasks. Today let’s look at some early notes on the effect of generative artificial intelligence on the broader web, and think through what it means for platforms. “If Google consistently gives you garbage results in search, for example, you might be more inclined to pay for sources you trust and visit them directly.”  Perhaps.

As we’ve seen over the past week, collectively those moderators wield real power: traffic dropped an estimated 6.6 percent last week as subreddits went dark, according to one estimate.

And in response to Huffman’s dismissive memo, moderators of hundreds of communities now say they will extend the blackout indefinitely beyond its planned two days. One criticism I heard of my piece yesterday is that Reddit had given developers more than 30 days’ notice, contrary to what some developers have complained about.

In Reddit’s case, though, it seems like a more or less moot point — third-party apps will likely no longer be around to display any posts, NSFW ones included. As Ben Thompson lays out today — and this was also true of alternate Twitter clients — third-party Reddit apps don’t carry the advertising that the native app does. The deal had a deadline of July 18, but it’s now tied up by both a U.K. appeal and the FTC’s ongoing lawsuit. Instead, the company bought Alien Blue, a third-party app built on top of the company’s free API. The API has been essential given how slowly the core Reddit product has evolved; the company didn’t even have a true native iOS app until 2014. It’s easy to see how, in the run-up to an IPO, an increasingly finance-minded company would see that as a loose end that needed to be tied up.
